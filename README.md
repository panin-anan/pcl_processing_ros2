# SAMXL_pointcloud_area_detection

## Overview
Code to perform volume loss calculation between two point clouds: before grinding and after grinding, scanned by laser line scanner.
The node works in conjuction with data_gathering. The test data is recorded using rosbags.

## Installation

#### Dependencies (INCOMPLETE)
- ROS2 Humble
- pyads
- open3d



```bash
pip install pyads
pip install open3d==0.18.0
pip install numpy==1.24.0

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install ros-humble-rosbag2-storage-mcap
```

#### Building
To build from source, clone the latest version from this repository into your workspace along with the following repositories

- `ferrobotics_acf`: Controls the ACF

## Node
### pcl_processing


### pcl_publish_manual
A node that manually publish point cloud message to pcl_processing to manually evaluate tested data/point clouds
Parameters:
- `plc_target_ams`: AMS ID of the PLC.
- `plc_target_ip`: IP address of the PLC.
- `timeout_time`: Maximum time allowed before timeout.
- `time_before_extend`: Time delay before ACF extension to allow the grinder to spin up.
- `rpm_control_var`: Name of variable which controls the RPM through PLC.
- `grinder_on_var`: Name of variable for turning the grinder on/off.
- `grinder_enabled`: Bool that enables or disables the grinder.
- `time_var`: Name of variable for PLC timestamps.
- `max_acf_extension`: Maximum allowed ACF extension.

Topics:
- `/acf/force` [Float32Stamped](https://github.com/Luka140/stamped_std_msgs/blob/main/msg/Float32Stamped.msg): Publishes the force applied during grinding.
- `/grinder/rpm` [Int32Stamped](https://github.com/Luka140/stamped_std_msgs/blob/main/msg/Int32Stamped.msg): Publishes the grinder's actual RPM. Solely for logging purposes.
- `/grinder/requested_rpm` [Int32Stamped](https://github.com/Luka140/stamped_std_msgs/blob/main/msg/Int32Stamped.msg): Publishes the requested RPM. Solely for logging purposes.
- `/timesync` [TimeSync](https://github.com/Luka140/stamped_std_msgs/blob/main/msg/TimeSync.msg): Publishes time synchronization messages between ROS and PLC.

 - `/acf/telem` [ACFTelemStamped](https://github.com/Luka140/ferrobotics_acf/blob/humble/msg/ACFTelemStamped.msg): Subscribes to ACF telemetry, handling force and position data.

Services:
- execute_test [TestRequest](https://github.com/Luka140/data_gathering_msgs/blob/main/srv/TestRequest.srv): Starts a test by setting force, RPM, and contact duration. It handles RPM control, ACF engagement, monitoring grinder performance, and managing shutdown sequences on test completion or failure.


### test_coordinator
A node that cycles through the tests specified in the launch file. It coordinates the grinds, scans, volume calculations, and data recording. 

Parameters:
- `force_settings`: list of force settings for the queued tests
- `rpm_settings`: list of RPM settings for the queued tests
- `contact_time_settings`: list of contact time settings for the queued tests
- `grit`: the grit of the sanding belt - for logging purposes
- `sample`: handle/name by which to identify the tests - for logging purposes
- `plate_thickness`: the thickness of the plate in mm. 

- `belt_prime_force`: the force setting at which to prime a new belt
- `belt_prime_rpm`: the RPM setting at which to prime a new belt
- `belt_prime_time`: the time setting at which to prime a new belt
- `initial_prime`: bool to indicate whether a prime run needs to be performed before the first queued test
- `wear_threshold`: the threshold of the belt wear indicator after which the belt needs to be changed

- `data_path`: path to the data storage location
- `wear_tracking_path`: path to the storage location of the belt run history to calculate wear
- `test_tracker_path`: path to file which tracks all tests that have been run
- `record_path`: path to rosbag storage
